# What is programming ?

# Presenter notes

First we’ll introduce some basic programming concepts, then we’ll talk about some of the specific ways we use the Python language to write programs.

* A **computer** is a machine that **stores** and **manipulates** information

* A **program** is a detailed set of instructions telling a computer exactly what to do.

# Presenter notes

Computers are really dumb - they’ll only do exactly what you tell them to do.

So you have to be the smart one and give them good instructions.

That’s what we’re going to learn about here today.

# Algorithms

# Presenter notes

*Algorithm* is a name for the instructions we give to computers - they’re like recipes, with specific steps to follow

    >>> 1 + 2
    >>> 12 - 3
    >>> 6 * 5

# Math

## Another arithmetic operator:

* division: **/**
